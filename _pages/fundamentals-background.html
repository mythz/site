                            Message-based design is enabled in ServiceStack by capturing the Services Request Query into a Request DTO that’s completely de-coupled from any one implementation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pt-4 text-left clearfix">
                            There are <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/advantages-of-message-based-web-services">many natural benefits gained when adopting a message-based design</a> they offer better resilience, flexibility, versionability than their RPC cousins.
                            Most of the benefits of message-based designs are gained over time as you’re developing and evolving your existing services and adding support for more clients.
                            <strong>One immediate benefit is being able to provide an end-to-end typed API without the use of code-gen</strong>. This is impossible to achieve without a message-based design which ensures the essence of your Service Contract is captured in re-usable DTOs.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pt-4 text-left clearfix">
                            Conceptually in ServiceStack you’re just sending a message to a ServiceStack instance, the client is not concerned with what ultimately handles it, only that a response is returned for reply requests or that the request is successfully accepted for oneway messages. In a RPC API you’re conceptually invoking a remote method which has the request tightly coupled to its remote implementation method signature.

                            The message based approach ServiceStack takes goes hand in hand with API first development.
                            Having well-defined, coarse-grained Service Contracts which are made up from decoupled, implementation free message DTO, enables a client agnostic API for all client types since they all consume the same published APIs as each other.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pt-4 text-left clearfix">
                            If your Services retain this property then they’ll be able to encapsulate any of its capabilities of infinite complexity and make it available remotely to all consumers with never any more complexity than the cost of a Service call.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pt-4 text-left clearfix">
                            This is ultimately where most of the value of Services are derived, they’re the ultimate form of encapsulating complexity and offers the highest level
                            of software reuse. ServiceStack amplifies your Services capabilities by making them available in multiple <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/why-servicestack#multiple-hosting-options">Hosting Options</a>,
