We're excited to share the next release of ServiceStack which sees the introduction of our simple Database Migration solution with Code-First DB Migrations which advances OrmLite's light-weight code-first development approach with a simple [change based migration](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/types/relational/what-are-database-migrations#change-based-migrations) solution that facilitates the code-first development workflow of OrmLite. 

Starting from a seamless quick install and supporting multiple running options from command-line tooling, IDE run npm scripts, run, debug & verify from unit tests and integrated with our GitHub Action deployments where only successful migrations are deployed.

Instead of relying on generation by an opaque tool, this code-first approach treats DB Migrations like any other maintainable & logically structured code written by developers where it maintains a connected audit history in source control together with the feature that needs the schema changes.

The Redis Admin UI lets you manage your App's configured Redis Server with a user-friendly UX for managing core Redis data types, simple search functionality to quickly find Redis values, quick navigation between related values, first class support for JSON values and a flexible command interface and command history to inspect all previously run redis commands that's easily editable & rerun.

The new built-in Database Admin UI lets you quickly browse your App's configured RDBMS schemas and tables, which without any additional configuration your App's configured databases, their schemas, tables and any registered [named connections](/ormlite/getting-started#multiple-database-connections) will be navigable from the home page where they'll be browsable with a familiar tabular search results grid, similar in appearance and functionality to [Locode's Auto UI](https://locode.dev) where their resultsets can each be personalized with flexible query preferences and filtering options that's persisted across browser restarts.
