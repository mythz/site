With the release of [.NET Core 3.1 LTS](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/) we've standardized our Project Templates
and tools to **.NET Core 3.1 LTS** whilst continuing to support existing **.NET Core 2.1+** and **.NET Framework** projects including
[ASP.NET Core Apps on the .NET Framework](https://docs.servicestack.net/templates-corefx).
