This release continues to bring improvements across the board with a major async focus on most of ServiceStack's existing sync APIs gaining pure async implementations allowing your App's logic to use their preferred **sync** or **async** APIs.

Improvements to [AutoQuery CRUD](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-crud), ServiceStack [Studio](https://docs.servicestack.net/studio) and new **User Admin Module** allows you to develop new systems from scratch at an unprecedented pace using only declarative code-first C# POCOs to define both system Data Models and their Typed API-first System inputs/outputs.
