To see the rapid development of AutoQuery in action we've created a quick demo showing how to create a simple multi-user Booking System from an empty [web](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/web) project, [mixed in](https://docs.servicestack.net/mix-tool) with the preferred RDBMS & Auth layered functionality, before enabling [Validation](https://docs.servicestack.net/validation), [AutoQuery](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-rdbms), Admin Users & [CRUD Event Log](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-audit-log) plugins - to lay the foundational features before building our App by first defining its `Booking` data model & its surrounding **Query**, **Create**, **Update** and **Soft Delete** Typed CRUD APIs with rich validation enforced by declarative Validation attributes and multi-layer authorization rules & access permissions protected using Authorization attributes.

We've caught a glimpse of the new User Admin Feature in the [Bookings CRUD demo](https://youtu.be/XpHAaCTV7jE) who utilizes it to create **Employee** and **Manager** users. The `AdminUsersFeature` provides Admin User Management APIs enabling remote programmatic access to your registered [User Auth Repository](https://docs.servicestack.net/authentication-and-authorization#user-auth-repository), featuring:

- Works with existing `IUserAuthRepository` sync or async providers
- Utilizes Progressive enhancement, e.g. search functionality utilizes `IQueryUserAuth` (if exists) performing a wildcard search over multiple fields, otherwise falls back to exact match on `UserName` or `Email`
- Supports managing Auth Repositories utilizing custom `UserAuth` data models
- Flexible UI options for customizing which fields to include in Search Results and Create/Edit UIs
- Rich Metadata aggregating only App-specific Roles & Permissions defined in your App
- User Events allow you to execute custom logic before & after each Created/Updated/Deleted User

As mobile Apps is a target use-case for ServiceStack, this release also includes 1st class integration with **Sign In with Apple** OAuth provider. To assist with adoption we've also developed Sign In with Apple Integration Examples for iOS, Android & Web with working implementations for Flutter iOS/Android & SwiftUI Apps.
