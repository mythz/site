Ordinarily we'd have a longer release cadence in between releases with more features, but with the recent release of .NET Core 3
we've cut this release cycle short so we can release a version of ServiceStack compatible with .NET Core 3+. Other than that the major focus
on this release was `#Script` with [many new features](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.7#script) we're excited to share after covering the ServiceStack changes.

We've seen great reception of [Gist Desktop Apps](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.6#gist-desktop-apps) from the last v5.6 release with a
nice shoutout from [Jon Galloway](https://twitter.com/jongalloway) in the
[ASP.NET Community August Stand up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2lq4yEfJpk&feature=youtu.be&t=1529),
a featured [blog post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/SharpScriptFromServiceStackLetsYouRunNETAppsDirectlyFromAGitHubGist.aspx)
from [Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman) as well features in Hacker News and Reddit.

We've since further enhanced `#Script` capabilities in this release making it more functional then ever, broadening its appeal
in its growing list of use-cases.
