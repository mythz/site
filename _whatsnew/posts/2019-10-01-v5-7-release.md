Ordinarily we'd have a longer release cadence in between releases with more features, but with the recent release of .NET Core 3
we've cut this release cycle short so we can release a version of ServiceStack compatible with .NET Core 3+. Other than that the major focus
on this release was `#Script` with [many new features](#script) we're excited to share after covering the ServiceStack changes.
