The new Auto HTML Page is the best way to visualize, inspect and integrate with your APIs which provides instant utility for API consumers in consuming your APIs with a built-in API Response Visualizer, JSON syntax highlighting, integrated Postman-like UI and API SDK integration all-in-one.

A nice benefit of ServiceStack's API Design is that consuming APIs are fundamentally all done the same way in all languages, which just requires adding a dependency containing a generic ServiceClient which can be used to call any ServiceStack API using the typed DTOs copied directly from the API docs page to enable an end-to-end typed API without any external tooling or build steps.

The new AutoQueryGrid component is the last high-productivity component missing from the Vue Tailwind Component Library to reach feature parity with Blazor Tailwind Component Library.

It enables an Effortless CRUD UI without any external dependencies, tooling or build steps, generating a capability-based UI for the currently authenticated user, enabling full CRUD functionality through the App's auth-protected AutoQuery APIs, validated by the APIs Declarative Validation Rules utilizing optimal Form Inputs for each C# property type with contextual validation binding, that displays its results in a rich formatted data grid customized with APIs Declarative UI Attributes.

With access to all components needed, we've taken this opportunity to modernize all of ServiceStack's built-in UI's that were previously written with petite-vue and have rewritten them with Vue 3 and the Vue Components Library, which has become our preferred UI technology stack for all of ServiceStack's built-in UIs.

Ultimately the new Vue 3 UIs should appeal to a lot more use-cases with better reuse and customizability using the full Vue 3 framework and 3rd Party ecosystem for creating more compelling and interactive UIs.

The `/api` route is now being used as an opportunity to improve API Discovery by returning an App's public APIs grouped by user-defined tags with direct links to the API endpoint, viewing it in API Explorer and in Locode for AutoQuery APIs.
