The new Tailwind Razor Pages & MVC Templates enable rapid development of Modern Tailwind Apps without the pitfalls plaguing SPA development:

- **[vue-mjs](https://vue-mjs.web-templates.io)** - Flagship Vue.mjs template with OrmLite, AutoQuery, boosted htmx links & static pre-rendered blogs
- **[razor-tailwind](https://razor-tailwind.web-templates.io)** - Simple Razor Pages Template without DB or pre-rendering
- **[mvc-tailwind](https://mvc-tailwind.web-templates.io)** - Want to use MVC Identity Auth and Entity Framework
- **[web-tailwind](https://web-tailwind.web-templates.io)** - Empty tailwind template with no web framework configured
- **[vue-vite](https://vue-vite.jamstacks.net)** - Vite + TypeScript in a simpler JAMStack Vite SPA App
- **[vue-ssg](https://vue-ssg.jamstacks.net)** - Vite + TypeScript in an advanced JAMStack Vite SSG App

To maximize productivity, all new Vue Tailwind templates are pre-configured to use the feature-rich [Vue 3 Taiwlind Library](https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/).

**@servicestack/vue** is our growing Vue 3 Tailwind component library with a number of rich Tailwind components useful in .NET Web Apps, including DataGrids, Auto Forms, Modals, Slide Overs, Navigational Components, Formatters, standard HTML Form Input controls inc. FileInput, Autocomplete, TagInput - all with integrated contextual validation binding.

It's our cornerstone library for enabling a highly productive dev model across our Vue.js Tailwind Project templates that we'll be continuing to invest in to unlock even greater productivity - watch this space!

The new ES6 classes provide a productive type-safe development model during development but can also be referenced as-is in JS Module scripts and run natively in browsers to enable instant typed API integrations without any build tools!

To achieve this the ES6 classes are annotated with JSDoc type hints in comments which enjoys broad support in IDEs and tools like TypeScript where it can be used to provide type information in JavaScript files.

They're now a first-class Add ServiceStack Reference language supported language complete with IDE integration in the latest ServiceStack Plugins for VS .NET and JetBrains IDEs.

Prerendering static content is a popular technique used by JAMStack Apps to improve the performance, reliability and scalability of Web Apps that's able to save unnecessary computation at runtime by generating static content at deployment which can be optionally hosted from a CDN for even greater performance.

As it's a valuable performance optimizing technique it's included in the [vue-mjs](https://vue-mjs.web-templates.io) template to show how it can be easily achieved within a Razor Pages App. Since prerendered content is only updated at deployment, it's primarily only useful for static content like markdown powered blogs.

For those interested in utilizing this optimization we've published details on how this works in the 
**[Prerendering Razor Pages](https://vue-mjs.web-templates.io/blog/prerendering)** blog post.
