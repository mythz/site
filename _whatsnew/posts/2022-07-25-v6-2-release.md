The feature-rich [Blazor WASM Tailwind](https://docs.servicestack.net/templates-blazor-tailwind) template us ideal for teams with strong C# skills building Line Of Business (LOB) applications who prefer utilizing Tailwind's modern utility-first CSS design system to create beautiful, instant-loading Blazor WASM Apps.

All Blazor WASM templates [incorporate prerendering](https://blazor-tailwind.jamstacks.net/docs/prerender) to achieve their [instant load times](https://blazor-tailwind.jamstacks.net) that greatly benefits the built-in markdown pages with great SEO

Having achieved the best architecture for delivering [max value](https://jamstacks.net/posts/hosting) and performance with our [jamstacks.net](https://jamstacks.net) templates, the last expensive vital component used in most Web Apps is hosting of their expensive managed databases. Despite most RDBMS's being OSS and free of licensing costs, major cloud companies continue to charge artificially high hosting costs to provide redundant hosting of App data.

[Litestream](https://litestream.io) lets us avoid these expensive hosting costs by providing transparent per-second replica backups to inexpensive managed storage, enabling latency-free queries, simplified hosting architectures at vastly reduced hosting costs.

The new Request Logging & Profiling UIs bring an invaluable new level of observability into your App, from being able to quickly inspect and browse incoming requests, to tracing their behavior from their generated events in the new [Diagnostic Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.diagnosticsource?view=net-6.0) capabilities added all throughout ServiceStack, which both power the new UIs and enables new introspectability from code where you can now to tap in to inspect & debug when each diagnostic event occurs.

The DB Validation feature leverages the existing [Declarative Validation](https://docs.servicestack.net/declarative-validation) infrastructure where it enables dynamically managing Request DTO Type and Property Validators from a RDBMS data source which immediately takes effect at runtime that carries the same performance profile at runtime as they can be optionally cached where they'll only need to be re-hydrated from the database after modification.
