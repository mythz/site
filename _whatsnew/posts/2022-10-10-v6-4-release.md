We're excited to announce exciting new Blazor Components enabling a compelling a Rapid Application Development platform for Blazor Apps delivering many of the productivity benefits previously limited to [locode.dev](https://www.locode.dev).

Our new native Blazor Components allows for a beautiful progression story where you can start with a [Database-First Locode](/locode/database-first) solution to instantly [generate Data Models and CRUD APIs](/locode/database-first#exporting-to-code-first-types) around your existing databases that thanks to the new `AutoQueryGrid` Blazor component will be able to trivially implement both CRUD UI's and optimized Blazor UIs in the same Blazor App.

We're happy to announce our new Blazor Server App template offering a number compelling advantages over Blazor WASM, including:

 - A superior dev model and debugging experience
 - Improved live-reload and faster iterative dev cycles
 - Full access to .NET Server functionality 
 - Better start times & UI responsiveness 
 - Less complexity from unnecessary client project or pre-rendering solutions

ServiceStack.Blazor Components gives you the ideal development workflow without compromise. Effortless, highly productive, API integrated Rich Blazor UI Components with 100% Server model reuse and integrated contextual validation.

To better showcase our growing Blazor functionality we've created new Blazor Gallery websites showcasing usage of available rich Blazor Components for rapidly develop beautiful Tailwind Web Apps available in both [Blazor Server](https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net) and [Blazor WASM](https://blazor-gallery.jamstacks.net) Web Apps.

We've continued improving our story around [Code-First DB Migrations](/ormlite/db-migrations) and have created a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/NIVFqute7JQ) demonstrating how it can be used to maintain DB Schema migrations under a typical development workflow.

As they encourage a structured workflow for incremental development of new App features we've upgraded all modern [jamstacks.net](https://jamstacks.net)
templates to adopt DB Migrations for creating and populating their App DB.

A benefit of DB Migrations being implemented in a library instead of wrapped up behind an external tool, is that it's better integrated and more versatile in supporting more executable options like being able to run from code, a feature the new `MigrationTasks` Explicit TestFixture benefits from enabling DB Migrations to be run or debugged directly from within your IDE.
