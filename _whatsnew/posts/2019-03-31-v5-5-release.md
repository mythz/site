Before we get into unpacking this release we're happy to announce that we've now eclipsed **10 years** since our
[first commit](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/commit/2a9cd0d10247ae1a679ac011d7bdef593937dba4)! 

And with that we have another jam-packed release with exciting features across the board, if you haven't got enough time to go through it all today,
feel free to jump directly to the features you're interested in:

- #Script
- World Validation
- "No touch" Host Configuration
- Page Based Routing in Razor!
- And much more!
