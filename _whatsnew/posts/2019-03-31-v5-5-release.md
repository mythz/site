Before we get into unpacking this release we're happy to announce that we've now eclipsed **10 years** since our
[first commit](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/commit/2a9cd0d10247ae1a679ac011d7bdef593937dba4)! 

I'd like to take this milestone to thank our thousands of Customers we've had the pleasure to serve and see our Software used which has amassed
more than **27,000,000+ total downloads** on NuGet and to see the uptick in adoption of some of our unique features like
[Add ServiceStack Reference](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference) which has been used more than **88,000 times**
to generate native Typed DTOs amongst its [8 supported languages](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference#supported-languages).

As we continue enhancing ServiceStack's scripting support with exciting new features, it no longer made sense to call our dynamic scripting language
"Templates" which is just one of the many use-cases `#Script` enables.

[#Script](https://sharpscript.net) is typical of a popular dynamic template language you'd find in other platforms, using the ubiquitously familiar mix of
[JavaScript Expressions](https://sharpscript.net/docs/expression-viewer) which for increased wrist-friendly readability can be easily composed
together using the Unix `|` operator as embraced by [Vue.js filters](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html#header) and
[Angular's Template Expressions](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#template-expression-operators)
whist the [Script Statement Blocks](https://sharpscript.net/docs/blocks) adopt the universally adopted Handlebars-like syntax that's ideal for
rendering dynamic pages.
