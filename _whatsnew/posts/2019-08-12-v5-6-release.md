We want to dramatically simplify and improve the experience for configuring ASP.NET Core Apps and make them truly composable,
where we can drop-in files that auto configures itself with both ASP.NET Core and ServiceStack's AppHost so they can
encapsulate an entire feature and provide instant utility without needing to wade through different steps of how they
should be manually configured at different places in your Startup configuration class.

To complete the picture of making it easy as possible to compose ASP.NET Core Apps we've created the `mix` dotnet tool to easily
install features which can be installed with:

    $ dotnet tool install --global mix

The `mix` tool is designed around applying ASP.NET Core features captured in GitHub gists to your local .NET Core projects. 

Then choosing which features you want to add to your project with `mix <name>`, e.g:

    $ mix redis

To lay the foundation for richer and more tightly integrated UI controls, we've created UI and common component libraries for the
3 most popular JS frameworks:


 - [@servicestack/vue](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-vue)
 - [@servicestack/react](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-react)
 - [@servicestack/angular](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-angular)


All new [Single Page App Project Templates](https://docs.servicestack.net/templates-single-page-apps) have been pre-configured to use these libraries which will make it
a lot easier to deliver new UI components and updates to existing SPA Apps with just an npm upgrade.
