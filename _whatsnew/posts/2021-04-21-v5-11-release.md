Building upon our native end-to-end typed solutions, we're excited to announce **Instant Client Apps** to
provide instant utility and value around your ServiceStack Services where your API consumers can use the
Auto generated UI to craft API Requests in their preferred programming language:

<!--separator-->

We've begun to fully embrace GitHub Actions from this release to help quickly setting up CI environments for
new and existing ServiceStack project templates by automating them into building and running tests on each **commit**
before publishing, dockerizing & deploying them on each **GitHub Release**.
The templates leverage [mix](https://docs.servicestack.net/mix-tool) to work like lego pieces where they can be combined to achieve your
preferred automation workflow.

In addition to the Refresh Token support & built-in Inspect utils all ServiceStackâ€™s generic Service Client libraries in all languages have received a number of updates to improve their consistency and overall development UX.
