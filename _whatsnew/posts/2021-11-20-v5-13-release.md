We've cut this release cadence short to focus on putting out a quality release to take advantage of the newest and best .NET runtime yet!

In a lot of ways .NET 6 marks the start of a new era for .NET with the first LTS release after the end of the 
.NET Framework and .NET Standard with only 1 actively developed runtime going forward.

We're moving full-steam ahead and have standardized our new features onto .NET 6 with: 

 - [All project templates upgraded to .NET 6](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5_13#all-project-templates-upgraded-to-net-6)
 - [net6.0 TFM builds added to all packages](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5_13#net6-0-tfm-builds-added-to-all-packages)
 - [Embracing .NET 6 new Hosting Model for mix](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5_13#net-6-new-hosting-model)
 - [v4.5 .NET Framework Deprecation Notice](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5_13#v4-5-net-framework-deprecation-notice)

Visual Studio 2022 now has support for Add ServiceStack reference for C#/F#/VBNET/TypeScript!

ServiceStackVS can be found in the Extension Marketplace, and is installable straight from Visual Studio 2022.
