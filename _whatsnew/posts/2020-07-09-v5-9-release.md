Another exciting development in this release is the successor to [Admin UI](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Admin):
**ServiceStack Studio!** - a capability-based UI to manage multiple remote ServiceStack instances from either a Chromium Desktop App
or cross-platform .NET Core Web App.

The richer metadata in ServiceStack Services allows Studio to logically group Services around Data Models, enabling its high-level
semantic features like its native data-grid like UX over all AutoQuery Services to quickly discover, search, create, update and
delete entities based on the available AutoQuery APIs and whether Authenticated Users have access to them.

ServiceStack also reached maximum autonomy for a Services framework where in addition to **AutoQuery** automatically providing your Services implementations,
**Studio** providing its instant UI, ServiceStack also gained the capability to **generate your entire API!** Including Typed API contracts,
data models, implementations & human-friendly pluralized HTTP API routes over an existing System RDBMS's tables!

ServiceStack's **AutoGen** enables a number of exciting possibilities, predominantly it's the fastest way to ServiceStack-ify an
existing systems RDBMS where it will serve as an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to quickly migrate to ServiceStack and access its
functionality ecosystem around ServiceStack Services:

An unintended consequence of **AutoGen** that's potentially universally appealing to even non .NET developers is that it's also a way to instantly
generate Types for all RDBMS tables in all of ServiceStack [supported client languages](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference),
which thanks to being configurable in a [Sharp App](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) can be executed from the command-line using
the [dotnet tools](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool)
