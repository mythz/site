We are excited to announce **free perpetual individual and OSS licenses** that you can generate yourself straight from our website, **no account required**.

As ServiceStack approaches 100M downloads on NuGet, we want to foster a growing community of users while removing financial barrier for individuals and Open Source projects to use this highly productive framework.

We are also creating two new community spaces for any developer to engage with each others

- GitHub Discuss
- Discord

Our **Premium Support and Customer Forums will remain** our priority channels of support for those with **paid** licenses.
We are creating these new spaces to be welcoming for all users of the framework.
We hope these new license options and community spaces will encourage developers build and share amazing projects with each other! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

A major new feature we have added in v6.0 is our new bundled API Explorer. Commonly, developers utilize tooling like Postman and SwaggerUI to have an easy way to interact
with services for both developers and customers. Now this functionality comes built into your new and existing projects bundled with the `MetadataFeature` plugin.

API Explorer allows you to not only explore your services, but also see how to start using it in your favorite client language, including:

- C#
- TypeScript
- Dart
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python
- Swift
- VB.NET
- F#

Checkout this [hosted example](https://blazor-wasm-api.jamstacks.net/ui) and read on to learn more about all the new features of API Explorer.

[jamstacks.net](https://jamstacks.net) is a new site we have built to make it easy to get started with a variety of different [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) templates utilizing ServiceStack's well defined APIs.

The `jam` in [jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack) stands of **J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkup, which is an architecture pattern to build fast, secure and easy to scale web applications.
By pre-rendering your content, enhancing with JavaScript and leveraging independently hosting, well defined APIs, you get a highly productive, flexible and performant system for the modern web.

Our new [`vue-ssg`](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-ssg) template uses [Vue3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) with a curated list of packages, and combines it with the amazingly fast [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) JavaScript build tool for **the best developer experience** and **instant** hot reloading.

Our new [Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) template](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm) offers a pure C# solution to building a high performance web application with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and ServiceStack.
We have included a new **ServiceStack.Blazor** library to speed up building UI control binding and error handling so you can focus on building your next Line Of Business application.

Blazor WASM enables C# developers to not have to worry about serialization between client and server since ServiceStack DTOs are shared and automatically serialized by Blazor.
The enables .NET teams to build and deliver high performance web applications without learning a JavaScript framework.

For teams with React experience, our new [Next.js template](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/nextjs) provides a great developer experience by utilizing ServiceStack to provide end to end typed APIs for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) powered client.

With a Blog, Bookings and Todo example already wired up using Next.js, this template provides a solid starting point for teams that want the engineering resources of Meta and Vercel, combined with the ease of use of ServiceStack APIs to power their application.
