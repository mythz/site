We're excited to announce [locode.dev](https://locode.dev), our **Rapid Application Development** solution to quickly develop 
beautiful Full Stack CRUD Apps around **AutoQuery APIs**, suitable for a wide number of use-cases including:

- Rapid prototyping by creating an instant UI around existing **Database-First** RDBMS tables
- Declarative **Code-First** development model with unprecedented customizability (exportable from Database-First)
- **Hybrid Apps** with a custom UI to optimize common workflows whilst using Locode's Auto UI to manage Back office tables

As Locode's UI is built on top of ServiceStack's industrial strength AutoQuery APIs, Hybrid Apps can benefit from its superior end-to-end typed development model for creating Web, Mobile & Desktop Apps.

Using [AutoQuery's AutoGen](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-autogen) enables the quickest way to modernize an existing database by dynamically creating Data Models & AutoQuery CRUD APIs from RDBMS table schemas at runtime.

Locode provides a highly functional UI out-of-the-box that doesn't rely on code-gen that allows you to only override the Custom UI or Custom API implementation when needed resulting in a significantly smaller code-base to maintain as reflected in the comparitive code-bases of a customized 
Northwind Locode App vs the Northwind code-base of a popular RAD code-gen tool for .NET

    <tr>
      <th>Locode Northwind</th>
      <th>Radzen Northwind</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>~120 lines</strong> of C#</td>
      <td><strong>~4500 lines</strong> of C# (generated)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="pr-2"><strong>29 lines</strong> custom Home Page</td>
      <td><strong>10k+ lines</strong> of Angular HTML/TS (generated)</td>

[Code-First](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/code-first) is the natural development model of [AutoQuery Services](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-rdbms) which facilitates the majority of a 
System and its UI can be developed from simple, declarative C# POCOs to define the underlying RDBMS Schema Data Models and the precise typed 
API DTO Contracts of their surrounding AutoQuery & CRUD APIs. The Data and Service models can be further enhanced by ServiceStack's vast 
[declarative attributes](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/declarative) where a significant amount of behavior, functionality and customization can be defined, ranging from:

- Customize how [Data Models map to DB Tables](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/declarative.html#table-data-model-attributes) & enlist RDBMS features
- [Customize Serialization & API behavior](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/declarative.html#custom-serialization)
- [Define AutoQuery & CRUD API behavior](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/declarative.html#autoquery-attributes)
- Define [Validation Rules](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/declarative.html#type-validation-attributes) and [Authorization restrictions](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/declarative.html#authentication-restrictions)
- [Annotate & Document APIs](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/declarative.html#annotate-apis)
- [Customize UI Behavior & Appearance](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/declarative.html#result-formatters)

Locode's declarative dev model lets you focus on your new App's business requirements where its data model, API capabilities, input validation & multi-user Auth restrictions can be defined simply using annotated C# POCOs.
This provides immense value at the start of the development cycle where functional prototypes can be quickly iterated to gather business requirements

Once requirements have solidified, its typed AutoQuery APIs can easily be reused to develop custom UIs to optimize important workflows.

[Talent Blazor](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TalentBlazor) is a new App showcasing an example of this where its entire back-office functionality can be managed through Locode whilst an optimized **Blazor WASM App** is created to optimize its unique workflow requirements which also benefits from the superior productive dev model of its Typed APIs.
