[Python](https://python.org) is one of the worlds most popular programming languages which 
excels in a number of industries thanks to its ease of use and comprehensive libraries. 

To maximize the experience for calling ServiceStack APIs within these environments 
ServiceStack now supports Python as a 1st class Add ServiceStack Reference supported language 
which gives Python developers an end-to-end typed API for consuming ServiceStack APIs, 
complete with IDE integration in [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as well as 
[built-in support in x dotnet tool](https://docs.servicestack.net//dotnet-tool#addupdate-servicestack-references) 
to generate Python DTOs for a remote ServiceStack instance from a single command.

Python has solidified itself as a powerhouse in Data Science and Machine Learning thanks to its 
best-in-class libraries as well as being at the forefront of Interactive Computing with its native 
support in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) - a popular realization of Donald Knuth’s 
[Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) 
paradigm where executable code is interlaced in a live document with natural language 
documentation, rich markup and embedded media. It’s become an invaluable medium for data 
science, scientists and researchers where it’s often used as an advanced REPL environment 
for data and computation exploration whose resulting knowledge and insights are easily 
captured and shared.

We’re excited to be able to join the beautiful interactive world of Jupyter Notebooks with 
both Simple UI and command-line tools for effortlessly generating customized Notebooks around 
typed ServiceStack APIs for Jupyter’s premier support for **Python**.

In addition to Python we've also extended support for generating customized pre-populated 
**C#** and **F#** Jupyter Notebooks by leveraging dotnet/interactive Jupyter kernel’s which
allows C# and F# .NET Developers to join Jupyter's interactive live programming paradigm
which they can either choose to run locally in the next gen JupyterLab UI or directly within 
VS Code using .NET Interactive's VS Code extension.

Notebooks have also become a popular medium for sharing institutional data and computational 
knowledge thanks to being able to capture and embed execution output and support for exporting 
in multiple popular document formats as used by GitHub with their Auto Preview support for
Notebooks. We also simplify configuring a Notebook GitHub repo to support executing C# and
F# Notebooks in [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) FREE cloud hosting servicew with our
`docker-jupyter` mix template.
