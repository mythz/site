Tailwind has revolutionized how we style our Web Apps with its mobile first design system that's dramatically simplified creating maintainable responsive Web Apps. It also excels at adding support for Dark Mode with its first-class dark: modifier allowing the use of standard tailwind classes to specify what elements should look like when viewed in Dark Mode.

We're happy to announce that Dark Mode support has been added to **all ServiceStack.Blazor Tailwind components** and all Blazor Tailwind project templates where you'll be able to toggle on/off Dark Mode with the new **DarkModeToggle** component.

The ServiceStack.Blazor component library continues to expand with exciting new Components and improvements, including:

 - **Autocomplete** - Rich content Input to quickly search & select items
 - **TagInput** - UX friendly input for managing a list of strings like words or tags
 - **FormStyle.Card** - Render Auto Forms from POCO classes in a Card Layout
 - **NavList** - Beautiful Nav Links list component with Icons + Descriptions
 - **Colored Buttons** - Render buttons in different primary Tailwind colors
 - **SelectInput Expressions** - Declaratively define Select Input Options
 - **Custom Edit & Create Forms** - Use forms in custom AutoQueryGrids

The goal of our increasing Blazor investments is to enable a highly productive and capable platform for rapidly developing a majority of internal Apps CRUD functionality as well as enabling a hybrid development model where the management of Back office supporting tables can be quickly implemented using custom AutoQueryGrid components freeing up developers to be able to focus a majority of their efforts where they add the most value - in the bespoke Blazor UI's optimized customer-facing UX.

To best demonstrate its potential we've created [blazordiffusion.com](https://blazordiffusion.com) - a new ServiceStack.Blazor App front-end for Stable Diffusion - a deep learning text-to-image model that can generate quality images from a text prompt. It's a great example of Hybrid Development in action where the entire user-facing UI is a bespoke Blazor App that's optimized for creating, searching, cataloging and discovering Stable Diffusion generated images, whilst all its supporting admin tasks to manage the back office tables that power the UI were effortlessly implemented with custom AutoQueryGrid components.

The recommendation to access DB's directly in Blazor Server components encourages a more tightly-coupled and less reusable & testable architecture than the traditional well-defined API dev model used in client/server Mobile & Desktop Apps or Web SPA Apps like Blazor WASM.

To achieve the best of both worlds, we've enabled support for utilizing the In Process Service Gateway in Blazor Server Apps which lets you retain the traditional client/server dev model for invoking your Server APIs In Process - avoiding any serialization, HTTP networking or even Kestrel middleware overhead to invoke your APIs directly!

This enables using the exact same source code to call APIs in Blazor Server and WASM which allows us to develop reusable Blazor Components to invoke the same Server APIs that serve Web, Mobile and Desktop Apps in Blazor Server Apps.
