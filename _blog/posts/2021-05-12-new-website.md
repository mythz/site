ServiceStack has had the same website now for quite a few years, and we wanted to make finding learning resources and other information about ServiceStack.

After 7+ years of focusing solely on product development, we have the resources and time to focus on getting the word out about ServiceStack and making it easier to discover and learn.

While we've taken a lot of pride in the release notes and feature documentation, our docs haven't really had a clear delineation between helping those already familiar with ServiceStack, and those that are discovering it for the first time.

The new website is a part of our current efforts on making resources that guide people, in a more directed way, to the resources they need so they can get on with building great web services and applications.

We will also be openly sharing our experience with some marketing efforts to reach a wider group of developers. The reason this is noteworthy is because, until very recently this is something that was intentionally put to the aside since the very start of ServiceStack.

To highlight what we mean but 'put aside', here is our Google Search Console performance view showing the last 12 months of clicks and impressions.

The filter isn't broken, there just wasn't any data until the 2021-05-12! So we are really starting this effort from the beginning.

If this kind of thing interests, stay tuned as we'll be sharing various efforts and milestones. The hope is it will be useful for others as well as ourselves, and if nothing else, it should be good for a laugh :).
